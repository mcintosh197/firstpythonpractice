Importing maths to do calculations
'''

# import math
#
# weight = 203.2  #weight in grams
# floorWeight = math.floor(weight)
# ceilWeight = math.ceil(weight)
#
# print(floorWeight, ceilWeight)

'''
Not a fan of this because it's difficult for other people to read
'''

# from math import *
#
# weight = 203.2  #weight in grams
# floorWeight = floor(weight)
# ceilWeight = ceil(weight)
#
# print(floorWeight, ceilWeight)

'''
These are the preferred ways of doing it because of people can read it
'''

# from math import floor
# from math import ceil
#
# weight = 203.2  #weight in grams
# floorWeight = floor(weight)
# ceilWeight = ceil(weight)
#
# print(floorWeight, ceilWeight)
# ----------------------------------
# from math import floor, ceil
#
# weight = 203.2  #weight in grams
# floorWeight = floor(weight)
# ceilWeight = ceil(weight)
#
# print(floorWeight, ceilWeight)
