'''
While loop that is never ending because it's not incremented
'''

# x = 1
# while x < 10:
#     print(x)
#
# print("all done")

'''
Looping through lists
'''

# dwarfs = ["Bashful", "Doc", "Dopey", "Happy", "Sleepy", "Sneezy", "Grumpy"]
#
# print("The dwarfs are called:")
# for dwarf in dwarfs:
#    print(dwarf)

''''
While loop through numbers 1 to 10
'''

# x = 1
# # while x <= 11:
#     print(x)
#     x = x + 1
#
# print("all done")


'''
Showing bad practice of ending at a number instead of using length of the list to end
This is bad practice because when the list is changed then it will change with the length function
